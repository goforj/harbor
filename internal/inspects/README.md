# Inspects

`internal/inspects` provides execution-scoped inspection records for Lighthouse.

An inspect is a bounded record of one unit of work, such as:

- an HTTP request
- a scheduler run
- a CLI command
- app startup

Each inspect keeps:

- summary metadata
- ordered timeline events
- source-specific labels

Lighthouse uses this package to power its runtime inspect views.

## What Gets Captured

The package captures normalized operational events rather than arbitrary logs or spans.

Common event kinds include:

- `http`
- `query`
- `cache`
- `mail`
- `log`
- `error`

For HTTP requests, the timeline can also include an `http_exchange` event with:

- request method
- scheme
- host
- URI
- request headers
- request body
- response status
- response headers
- response body

## Execution Model

Capture is execution-scoped.

The normal flow is:

1. an ingress boundary starts an inspect with `Manager.Begin(...)`
2. code running inside that context records normalized events
3. the boundary ends the inspect with `Manager.Finish(...)`

During execution, inspect state is kept in process memory.

On finish, the inspect is finalized and handed to the outbound delivery path. In the current architecture:

- source runtimes keep capture local while an inspect is running
- finished inspects are queued into a bounded async publisher buffer
- batches are shipped to Lighthouse
- Lighthouse ingests and retains the finished records for browsing

This keeps the hot path cheaper than writing every event directly into shared storage as it happens.

## Runtime Controls

There are two different control surfaces:

- source-runtime protection and delivery
- Lighthouse-side retained browsing

Source-runtime controls:

- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_INFLIGHT`
  - maximum concurrent in-memory inspects
- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_EVENTS`
  - maximum retained timeline events per inspect
- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_SAMPLE_RATE`
  - probability from `0.0` to `1.0` of starting a new inspect
- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_BUFFER_SIZE`
  - finished-inspect outbound queue capacity
- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_INTERVAL`
  - maximum time a finished inspect waits before batch flush
- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_BATCH_SIZE`
  - maximum finished inspects per outbound batch

Lighthouse-side retained browsing:

- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_TOTAL`
  - retained recent inspect capacity inside Lighthouse

Examples:

```env
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_ENABLED=true
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_INFLIGHT=100
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_EVENTS=200
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_SAMPLE_RATE=1.0
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_BUFFER_SIZE=4096
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_INTERVAL=1s
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_BATCH_SIZE=100
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_TOTAL=1000
```

```env
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_ENABLED=true
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_INFLIGHT=250
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_EVENTS=300
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_SAMPLE_RATE=0.10
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_BUFFER_SIZE=4096
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_INTERVAL=1s
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_FLUSH_BATCH_SIZE=100
LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_MAX_TOTAL=5000
```

Sampling happens at inspect start.

- `1.0` means capture all eligible inspects
- `0.10` means capture about 10%
- `0.01` means capture about 1%
- `0.0` means skip inspect capture

## Delivery Model

Finished inspects are shipped to Lighthouse in batches.

Current transport shape:

- finished inspects only
- bounded non-blocking local buffer
- drop-on-full
- drop when Lighthouse is unavailable
- shared-secret authenticated Lighthouse connection

Important implication:

- source runtimes are not the long-term retained source of truth
- Lighthouse owns retained recent inspection history

## Enablement

Inspect capture is not on by default.

Enablement rules:

- `LIGHTHOUSE_INSPECT_ENABLED` explicitly controls inspect capture
- if it is unset, inspect capture stays off

## API Surface

Primary entry points:

- `inspects.NewManager()`
- `manager.Begin(ctx, source, name, labels)`
- `manager.Finish(ctx, status, err)`
- `manager.Recent(ctx, query)`
- `manager.ByID(ctx, inspectID)`
- `manager.SetPublisher(publisher)`
- `manager.SetPublishOnly(true)`

Context helpers:

- `WithInspectID(ctx, inspectID)`
- `InspectIDFromContext(ctx)`
- `WithRecorder(ctx, recorder)`
- `RecorderFromContext(ctx)`

Recorder methods:

- `recorder.InspectID()`
- `recorder.RecordEvent(event)`
- `recorder.Finish(status, err)`

The manager also exposes normalized helpers for framework-owned primitives, such as:

- `RecordLog`
- `RecordCacheEvent`
- `RecordMailEvent`
- `RecordQueryEvent`
- `RecordHTTPExchange`

Publisher support:

- `Publisher.Publish(record)`

This is how finished source-runtime inspects are handed to the Lighthouse delivery layer.

## Failure Behavior

Inspect capture is intentionally non-blocking.

If pressure or transport problems occur:

- sampled-out inspects are skipped at `Begin`
- if `MaxInflight` is exceeded, new inspects are skipped
- if the finished-inspect publish buffer is full, new finished inspects are dropped
- if Lighthouse is unavailable, new finished inspects are dropped

This package prefers bounded memory and low request-path interference over durable local retry.

## Usage Notes

- Inspects are for recent operational debugging, not long-term analytics.
- The retained Lighthouse browse window is intentionally bounded.
- Sampling is the first production pressure-control knob to reach for.
- `MaxInflight` protects process memory.
- `MaxEvents` protects per-inspect payload size.
- `BufferSize` protects the finished-inspect publish path.

If you need durable, long-lived, globally queryable execution history, that is a tracing or analytics problem, not the primary purpose of this package.

## Lighthouse Relationship

This package is the backend substrate for Lighthouse inspection views.

Current Lighthouse behavior assumes:

- inspect records are recent
- inspect records are bounded
- request/response data comes from captured inspect events
- list browsing reads Lighthouse-retained inspect summaries
- inspect detail reads by `trace_id`
- source runtimes ship finished records rather than owning retained browse history

## Benchmarking

GoForj includes an inspect overhead command for comparing request cost with inspects off vs on:

```sh
GOCACHE=/tmp/gocache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gomodcache \
go run ./cmd/forj bench:inspect-overhead --iterations=5000 --rounds=5
```

That command is useful when changing:

- HTTP exchange capture shape
- sampling defaults
- buffer/publisher behavior
- inspect manager hot-path behavior

## Performance Cost

Inspect capture is not free, but the path is pretty lean at this point.

A lot of work went into keeping the hot path small:

- in-memory capture while an inspect is running
- no per-event shared-store writes on the hot path
- bounded finished-inspect buffering
- batch shipping to Lighthouse
- pooled and typed internal data where it made sense

Most of the remaining request cost comes from HTTP exchange capture:

- request context replacement
- request and response header shaping
- request and response body capture when present
- building the final `http_exchange` event

Use this command when you want to measure it:

```sh
GOCACHE=/tmp/gocache GOMODCACHE=/tmp/gomodcache \
go run ./cmd/forj bench:inspect-overhead --iterations=5000 --rounds=5
```

It reports two scenarios:

- a tiny minimal request handler
- a more realistic JSON request/response path

Recent numbers were roughly:

- minimal request:
  - baseline around `0.6µs/op`
  - inspect-enabled around `1.3µs/op`
  - delta around `+0.7µs/op`
- JSON request/response path:
  - baseline around `1.8µs/op`
  - inspect-enabled around `5.4µs/op`
  - delta around `+3.5µs/op`

Those absolute numbers are the important part.

Even with inspect capture on, we are still talking about microseconds per request in these benchmark shapes, not milliseconds.

Two important caveats:

- very small handlers make the percentage overhead look worse than it feels in real workloads
- richer request/response capture increases overhead materially

So the short version is:

- the inspect pipeline itself is fairly lightweight
- most of what is left is HTTP request/response detail capture
- if you need to bring the cost down further, the next lever is capturing less detail by default

Sampling is still the main production control knob when you want visibility without paying the full cost on every request.

If you change capture richness or delivery behavior, rerun the overhead benchmark rather than assuming cost stayed flat.

## Current Caveat

The current implementation is optimized first for local process performance and Lighthouse fan-in.

If you later move toward richer live streaming or stronger durability guarantees, treat that as a separate design step rather than assuming every inspect must become a heavy centralized write on the hot path.
